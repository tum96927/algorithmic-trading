# Algorithmic Trading with Python

## Prerequisites

Before you can run the Stock Trading Simulator, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- Python (version 3.9 or later)
- Git (optional but recommended)

## Installation
1. install dependencies
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Clone the project repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/stock-trading-simulator.git
4. run python script:
   ```bash
   python alpaca_demo.py

This is a program very similar to what I proposed in my project proposal. This is intended to demonstrate that the tools that I have listed will work together.
